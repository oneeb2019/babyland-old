              Created in 2021, Rarie the Panther is Black Panther discovered by
              Bandy, in Bandyland. He wears a skull mask gifted to him by Saki
              Love Blossom, who grows skulls within its pistil. The Black
              Panther is apart of the animal class Panthera and symbolism dates

              Panthera and symbolism dates back to both ancient Africa, Greece
              and more. The Greek word for panther translated to “all-beast” and
              referred to the Dionysos as “The All.” That is exactly what Bandy
              intended Rarie to represent, EVERYONE! The Black Panther is said
              to be a natural born leaders, known and loved by all animals. In
              Africa, the panther is known to represent royalty and power. It is
              also RARE… an endangered species, protected by the civilization
              and thought of as a guardian angel.

              In most recent times the Black Panther is known to aid in
              revolution, bring change and renew old systems. This is exactly
              what the Rare Panther Party will do in the current space. Rarie is
              the brand mascot and will be one of the most recognizable
              fictional characters internationally.
