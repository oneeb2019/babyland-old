            <p>
              Created in 2021, Saki Love Blossom represents embracing life and
              death, growing together, and individuality as learn, adapt, and
              grow daily. Inspired by Bandyâ€™s time in Japan and the Japanese
              Cherry Blossom, Saki easily wins over everyone with her
              inviting-colored petals and cute skull pistil. In Japan, cherry
              blossoms are called sakura, a special flower for the people and
              the country.
            </p>
            <p>
              Cherry blossoms are a symbolic flower of the spring, a time of
              renewal, and the fleeting nature of life. Although their life span
              is very short, they bring great joy to the lives of everyone that
              encounters them.
